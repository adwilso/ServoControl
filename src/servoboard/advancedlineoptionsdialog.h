/** \class advancedLineOptionsDialog
 *
 * This same class is used for both global and line settings which means
 * that it has essentially two interfaces.
 * 
 * The reason for resuing this in two seperate locations is because code
 * reuse is good and Adam hates designer so he didn't want to make the
 * same ui twice.
 * 
 * It assumes that it is being used for the line options, and if it is
 * being used for global settings, then it must be told that explicitly.
 * 
 * Global values are returned using the getGlobalValues method, which is
 * called synchronously which means that the dialog must be modal (cannot
 * access the other parts of the ui when the dialog is up). This is done
 * by calling the intherited exec method. The choice to do this was made
 * because when editing global values, it make no sense to update the lines
 * or servo positions.
 * 
 * Line values are returned using the signal, dialogClosed, which allows
 * for the dialog to be called asynchronously. The call is made using the
 * show() method, and then the result will be recieved when the dialog is
 * closed. This will allow for the user to edit the current line positions
 * while choosing the values.
